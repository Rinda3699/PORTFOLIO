 <p>The on demand delivery services over the internet such as storage, databases, networking, software and analytics.
 It allows users to access and manage resources without needing to own or maintain physical infrastructure</p>. 
 
 <h3>Dependency on internet connection: cloud services are completely dependent on internet access, which means any local internet disruption can impact access to cloud services.</h3>
     <h3>Limited control: In cloud environments, much of the infrastructure is managed by service providers which limit users control over configurations in saas and paas. </h3>
         <h3>Vendor Lock In: Migrating from one cloud provider to another can be costly and time consuming due to compatibility issues and data migration challenges.</h3>
             <h3>Security and privacy risks: storing sensitive data in the cloud can make it more vulnerable to cyber attacks and data breaches.</h3>
